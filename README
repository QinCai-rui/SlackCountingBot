# Slack Counting Game Bot

A fun and interactive Slack bot that manages a collaborative counting game. Players take turns counting up, using simple numbers or complex mathematical expressions. The bot tracks stats, milestones, and user performance, encouraging friendly competition and mathematical creativity.

## Features

- Start counting from any number
- Support for complex mathematical expressions
- User stats tracking (successful counts, accuracy, average complexity)
- Milestones and achievements
- Role-based rewards (coming soon)
- Leaderboards (coming soon)

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the Discord Counting Bot created by supercrafter100. You can check out their bot at [https://countingbot.supercrafter100.com/](https://countingbot.supercrafter100.com/). While our bot shares similar core concepts, it has been built from the ground up for Slack and includes unique features like support for complex mathematical expressions.

## Development

This bot was developed as an experiment to test the capabilities of [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/), an AI-powered coding assistant. All code for this project has been written with the assistance of Cursor, showcasing the potential of AI in software development.
